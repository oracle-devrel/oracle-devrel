# Getting a Repository
The Developer Relations team has strived to make the process as easy and fast as possible.  While the process isn't perfect, it does allow you to quickly move forward.

## Requesting a Repo
### Oracle Employees
To request a repo, send an email to your manager, asking for approval to publish the solution.  In your email, be sure to include: repo name, brief description and the name of the other maintainers.

We ask that you please provide at least one additional maintainer for each repo you create.  This is good in keeping momentum for the project as well as providing coverage and support for the project when you're unavailable.

Once you get the approval from your manager, please forward this to (or CC it to begin with) [email](mailto:devrel_oss-ww@oracle.com).

### Non-Oracle Employees
Don't work at Oracle, but have a great idea that you'd like to collaborate with us on?  Terrific!  We're excited to work with you - simply send us an [email](mailto:devrel_oss-ww@oracle.com) to start the conversation.  :)

## About Your New Repo
The repo will come with public visibility, so there's nothing special to do to publish your work!  You'll be setup as a maintainer (along with the other people you've given as maintainers).  From there, you're ready to [start working with your repo](working_with_repos.md).
