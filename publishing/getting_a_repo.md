# Getting a Repository

The Developer Relations team strives to make getting a repository as easy and as fast as possible. While the process isn't perfect, it does allow you to quickly move forward.

## Requesting a Repo

### Oracle Employees

To request a repo, send an email to your manager, asking for approval to publish the solution. In your email, be sure to include: repo name, brief description, and the name of the other maintainers.

We ask that you please provide at least one additional maintainer for each repo you create. This is good in keeping momentum for the project as well as providing coverage and support for the project when you're unavailable.

Once you get the approval from your manager, please forward this to (or CC it to begin with) [this email](mailto:devrel-oss_ww@oracle.com).

### Non-Oracle Employees

Don't work at Oracle, but have a great idea that you'd like to collaborate with us on? Terrific. We're excited to work with you - simply [send us an email](mailto:devrel-oss_ww@oracle.com) to start the conversation. :)

## About Your New Repo

The repo will come with public visibility, so there's nothing special to do to publish your work. You'll be set up as a maintainer (along with the other people you've requested as maintainers). From there, you're ready to [start working with your repo](/working_with_our_repos).
